# PHP Changelog Fetcher

This project is a PHP script designed to fetch and compile the changelog of PHP functions from the official PHP documentation website. The changelogs are consolidated into a single HTML file for easy reference.

## Features

- Fetches changelogs for all PHP functions listed in the PHP manual.
- Generates a structured HTML file with a table of changelogs.
- Allows continuation from a specific function title if the process is interrupted.

## Prerequisites

- PHP 7.0 or higher
- cURL extension enabled
- simple_html_dom library

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/denizvatan/php-changelog-fetcher.git
   cd php-changelog-fetcher
   ```

2. **Install the dependencies:**
   Make sure you have the `simple_html_dom.php` file in your project directory. You can download it from [here](https://simplehtmldom.sourceforge.io/).

## Usage

1. **Run the script:**
   ```sh
   php changelog_fetcher.php
   ```

2. **Continue from a specific function title (if needed):**
   If the process is interrupted and you need to continue from a specific function, you can modify the script to call `continueFromTitle` method with the desired function title.

## Example

Here's an example of how to use the `continueFromTitle` method:

```php
$baseUrl = 'https://www.php.net/manual/en/';
$outputFile = 'phpChangelog.html';

$changelogFetcher = new ChangelogFetcher($baseUrl, $outputFile);
$changelogFetcher->fetch();

// If interrupted, continue from a specific function title:
$changelogFetcher->continueFromTitle($baseUrl . 'indexes.functions.php', 'IntlDateFormatter::create');
```

# Function Report Generator

This PHP script generates an HTML report of function usages in a specified folder by parsing an HTML file containing function names. The script fetches the content from a given URL, extracts function names from `<h1>` tags, searches for their usages in the provided folder, and creates an HTML report.

## Prerequisites

- PHP 7.4 or later
- [Ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) (for searching function usages)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository (if applicable)**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/function-report-generator.git
   cd function-report-generator

2. **Ensure Ripgrep is installed**:

Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

## Code Structure

- **ChangelogFetcher.php**: Contains the `ChangelogFetcher` class which handles fetching and compiling the changelogs.
- **simple_html_dom.php**: The `simple_html_dom` library for parsing HTML.
- **phpChangelog.html**: The output file generated by the script.
- **search-changes.php**: Contains the `FunctionReportGenerator` class which generates an HTML report of function usages in a specified folder.
